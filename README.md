## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
The purpose of this repository is to provide an example of exploratory data analysis (EDA) in the context of the 2021 Kaggle Machine Learning and Data Science Survey. My goal is to better understand data scientists in the Accounting/Finance industry by exploring the following questions:

1. Which countries had respondents from the Accounting/Finance industry? How do these countries rank in their respective percentage of respondents who work in the Accounting/Finance industry?
2. What ML and DS roles do accounting and finance professionals work in? What programming languages do they prefer and what algorithms are most popular?
3. What is the gender profile of all survey respondents? How does the Accounting/Finance industry rank among all other industries in the percentage of Data Scientists who identify as woman, non-binary or another gender descriptor?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
Included is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells are used to walk the reader through the analysis performed. The raw survey response data used in this analysis is openly available on Kaggle at the following website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2021

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings of this analysis can be found at the post available here
